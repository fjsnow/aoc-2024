# Advent of Code

Each solution is found at `days/<day>/solve.py`. It will read from your `input` file.

The template (`days/template/solve.py`) can read inputs in a variety of ways, passing an integer pick the input from the `inp` list in the code (allowing you to swap between multiple example inputs easily), and pasing `-r` will read from your `input` file. Passing nothing will read the first example input.

I use @scarvalhojr's [aoc-cli](https://github.com/scarvalhojr/aoc-cli) tool to download inputs and submit solutions.
