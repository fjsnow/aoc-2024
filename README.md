# Advent of Code

Each solution is found at `days/<day>/solve.py`.

Running with no arguments will solve the example given within the problem.
You can paste your solution into a file named `input`, then run `solve.py` to compute your solutions.

The template (`days/template/solve.py`) requires the flag `-r` to read from your `input` file, otherwise it will read from the `input` variable within your code.

I use @scarvalhojr's [aoc-cli](https://github.com/scarvalhojr/aoc-cli) tool to download inputs and submit solutions.
