# Advent of Code

Each solution is found at `days/<day>/solve.py`.

Running with no arguments will solve the example given within the problem.
You can paste your solution into a file named `input`, then run `solve.py` with the `-r` flag to run it against a real input.

I use @scarvalhojr's [aoc-cli](https://github.com/scarvalhojr/aoc-cli) tool to download and submit solutions.
